## FORTIFY - {work in progress}

Just sharing some good resources I've come across on my travels through the digital stratosphere to help people improve their opsec, self-sovereignty & anti-fragility. It's also just for me to have a good base in the one place to recommend to people as a starter in improving their digital resiliency.

I have used, intend to use or know of the privacy community recommending most of these and will do my best to keep them up to date, however, it's always good to use the links & do a bit of a search before using a service so you understand what it is you are getting into. It's also quite common for changes or new information to arise in privacy & security technology so it's worth checking for any recent updates via their communication pathways or searching online.

No major plans, intially just a minimalistic one-pager with a bit of a checklist and aggregating a few others who have done the same in a lot more depth. I hope it serves you well & helps your peace of mind.
